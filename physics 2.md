## 1. Kinematics (Describing Motion)

Kinematics describes motion without considering the forces that cause it.

* **Displacement (s):** A vector quantity showing the change in position. It has both magnitude and direction.
* **Distance:** A scalar quantity showing the path length, always positive.
* **Speed:** A scalar quantity, defined as distance divided by time.
* **Velocity (v):** A vector quantity, defined as displacement divided by time.
* **Acceleration (a):** The rate of change of velocity per unit time.

When acceleration is constant, the SUVAT equations are used.

1. Final velocity: v = u + a t

   * v = final velocity (m/s)
   * u = initial velocity (m/s)
   * a = acceleration (m/s²)
   * t = time (s)

2. Displacement: s = u t + 0.5 a t²

   * s = displacement (m)
   * The term u t is motion due to initial velocity, and 0.5 a t² is motion due to acceleration.

3. Velocity–displacement relation: v² = u² + 2 a s

   * Useful when time is not known.

4. Displacement using average velocity: s = (u + v) / 2 × t

   * This works because for constant acceleration the average velocity is (u + v) / 2.

**Graphs in Kinematics:**

* Displacement–time graph: the slope gives velocity.
* Velocity–time graph: the slope gives acceleration, and the area under the curve gives displacement.
* Acceleration–time graph: the area under the curve gives the change in velocity.

**Projectile Motion (ignoring air resistance):**

* Horizontal velocity: uₓ = u cosθ
* Vertical velocity: uᵧ = u sinθ
* Equations of motion: x = uₓ t, y = uᵧ t – 0.5 g t²
* Time of flight: T = (2 u sinθ) / g
* Range: R = (u² sin2θ) / g
* Maximum height: H = (u² sin²θ) / (2 g)

## 2. Dynamics (Forces and Newton’s Laws)

Dynamics explains the causes of motion using forces.

**Newton’s Laws:**

1. First law (law of inertia): an object remains at rest or moves with constant velocity if the net force on it is zero.
2. Second law: F = m a. The acceleration of an object is proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.
3. Third law: for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, acting on different bodies.

**Common Forces:**

* Weight: W = m g, the force of gravity acting downwards.
* Normal force (N): a support force acting perpendicular to a surface.
* Friction:

  * Static friction f ≤ μs N (resists the start of motion).
  * Kinetic friction f = μk N (acts once the body is sliding).
* Tension (T): force transmitted by a rope, string, or cable.
* Drag (air resistance): increases with speed, often proportional to v or v².

**Inclined Planes:**

* Component of weight down slope: m g sinθ
* Component into slope: m g cosθ
* Net force along slope: F = m g sinθ – friction

**Pulleys and Atwood’s Machine:**

* For an ideal rope and pulley (massless, frictionless), tension is the same throughout.
* Each mass must be treated separately with its own free-body diagram.

**Terminal Velocity:**

* As an object falls, drag increases until drag = weight.
* At this point net force = 0 and acceleration = 0.
* The object then falls at constant velocity, called terminal velocity.

## 3. Circular Motion

When an object moves in a circle at constant speed, its direction changes, so it is accelerating.

* Angular speed: ω = 2π / T = 2π f
* Linear speed: v = ω r
* Centripetal acceleration: a = v² / r = ω² r
* Centripetal force: F = m v² / r = m ω² r

The centripetal force is not a new type of force; it is provided by tension, friction, or gravity, depending on the situation.

**Special Cases:**

* Banking of a road (no friction): tanθ = v² / (r g)
* Vertical loop: at the top, v must be at least √(g r) for the object to stay in contact.

## 4. Work, Energy, and Power

**Work:** W = F d cosθ

* Work is done when a force causes displacement in the direction of the force.
* Only the component of the force parallel to displacement does work.

**Kinetic Energy:** Ek = 0.5 m v²

* Energy of motion, always positive.

**Gravitational Potential Energy:** Ep = m g h

* Energy due to position in a gravitational field.

**Elastic Potential Energy (spring):** Es = 0.5 k x²

* Stored in a stretched or compressed spring.

**Work–Energy Principle:**

* Net work done on a body equals the change in its kinetic energy.

**Conservation of Mechanical Energy:**

* If only conservative forces act, total energy (Ek + Ep) is constant.
* Non-conservative forces (like friction) remove energy from the system.

**Power:** P = W / t = F v

* The rate of doing work.
* If force and velocity are not parallel, P = F v cosθ.

**Efficiency:** η = (useful output / total input) × 100%

* No system is perfectly efficient; some energy is always lost as heat or sound.

## 5. Momentum and Impulse

**Momentum:** p = m v

* A vector quantity showing “quantity of motion.”

**Impulse:** F Δt = Δp

* The product of force and time equals the change in momentum.
* Graphically, impulse = area under a force–time graph.

**Collisions:**

* Elastic collisions: both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved.
* Inelastic collisions: momentum is conserved, but kinetic energy is not.
* Perfectly inelastic collisions: objects stick together, momentum is conserved, maximum kinetic energy is lost.
* Coefficient of restitution: e = (speed of separation) / (speed of approach), where 0 ≤ e ≤ 1.

## 6. Free-Body Diagrams

Free-body diagrams (FBDs) are essential to solving dynamics problems.

* Draw the object as a point.
* Show all forces with arrows from the center.
* Break forces into x- and y-components.
* Apply ΣF = m a separately in each direction.

## 7. Problem-Solving Strategy

1. Draw a clear diagram of the situation.
2. If forces are involved, draw a free-body diagram.
3. Identify what is known and what needs to be found.
4. Select the correct approach:

   * SUVAT equations for constant acceleration.
   * Energy conservation for systems with no non-conservative forces.
   * Momentum conservation for collisions or explosions.
   * Circular motion relations for curved paths.
5. Resolve forces into components.
6. Check units, dimensions, and significant figures.
